# About this project
This static site was designed to be an example of a more minimalist/material design for a product or company's landing page. It was built using React and Bootstrap, mainly to get a little practice with React and some more simple designs.

The deployed site can be found [here.](https://heyitsgwen.github.io/Simple-Landing-Page/)
